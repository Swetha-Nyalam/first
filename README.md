# Code Conversion and Deployment Workflow

This repository contains a workflow for converting a **Flask codebase** to a **FastAPI codebase** using **Fireworks**, deploying it to an **E2B sandbox**, and testing the deployment via a test URL.

## Workflow Overview

The diagram below explains the flow from a Flask codebase to deploying and testing a FastAPI application:

### Steps in the Workflow:

1. **Flask Code Base**:
   - Start with a Flask-based application. This serves as the initial codebase.

2. **Fireworks**:
   - Use the **Fireworks** framework to convert the Flask application to a FastAPI application. This conversion ensures that the functionality remains intact but adapts the code to FastAPI’s framework and structure.

3. **FastAPI Code Base**:
   - After conversion, you now have a FastAPI codebase ready for deployment. This new codebase is structured according to FastAPI standards and optimized for the framework’s asynchronous capabilities.

4. **E2B Sandbox**:
   - Deploy the FastAPI code to the **E2B Sandbox**, a testing environment that allows you to run and interact with your FastAPI app without affecting production.

5. **Test URL**:
   - Once deployed, the E2B Sandbox provides a **Test URL** that can be used to verify that the application is running correctly. You can send test requests to this URL to check the application's functionality.

## Steps to Implement the Workflow

### 1. Setup the Flask Codebase

Ensure that your Flask codebase is properly structured and functional. Place the code in a folder named `flask_code/`.

### 2. Convert the Flask Code to FastAPI

Use the Fireworks framework to convert the Flask codebase into a FastAPI application. Run the following command (assuming you have Fireworks installed):

```bash
### 3. Deploy FastAPI to E2B Sandbox

### 4. Test the Application.

### 5. Feedback for correction
